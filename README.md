## Overview of the Analysis
I have analyzed (August, 2019) data that provides insights on customer & product usage data from a bike sharing program in New York City. I have produced several visualizations using tableau in order to provide insights that might be applied to a bike sharing start up concept in Des Moines, IA.

## Results
Through my analysis of the data set, I've developed 7 insights.
1. Almost all bile rides are under an hour. The majority of these rides last less than 30 minutes.

2. The majority of users exhibit commuter behavior using ride bikes during rush hour periods (M - F, 8a & 5p - 6p).

3. Although males comprise the majority of our riders, males and female trip durations have the same usage.

4. Male & Female users both tend use our products during the rush hour periods. Unknown gender users have a more uniform distribution, but a propensity to use our products on weekends.

5. Users with gender data tend to be subscribers who use our products for commuting purposes. Whereas unknown gendered users tend to be 1 time customers who use product for leisure weekend activities.

## Summary
Based on these insights, we know that we have two main customer types (1) subscribers who use bikes to commute and (2) customers who use bikes for leisure activities. With this information, we need to evaluate whether or not Des Moines is a good market for a bike sharing program.
* Does the city have enough demand for leisure activities?
* Does the city have enough demand for subscription services?

In order to answer these questions, we will need to evaluate and compare the cities geographical layout, cars per capita, population density, and other factors. Comparing the two market areas over these and other criteria will allow us to know if a bike sharing program would prosper in a smaller market such as Des Moines, IA.
